This application is a Post Office Management. In the Post Office Management System project is a web based application for post office which  helps post office management and their customers. It handles  types of deposit details of the post office. In my project I have used two modules that are user and admin.

The customer can view the types of deposits and types of posts. If the customer is an account holder they should fill only the sign in form then they can move to the customer dashboard. If the customer is a new customer they have to create a new account then they can move to the customer dashboard. I used validation. 

Then the customer can  decide they are going to deposit or parcel booking after deciding they can move to the deciding module. Then they have filled the form to decided section and after filling they can deposited the money or booking our parcel. In the parcel booking time the customer that they can get their tracking number, then the customer they have enter the tracking number. Then they can get the status of our parcel.

Then the admin can  view the deposit customers list, and parcel booking customers list ,and they can also update the customers parcel is delivered or processing.
